Just a simple PRM and PASL that watches the DNS servers used by all IPs on your monitored network. When a client makes a DNS server change, we report it in realtime mode.

To use:
0) Just copy the .pasl to /opt/pvs/var/pvs/scripts folder. 
1) To be safe, run chattr +i /opt/pvs/var/pvs/scripts/*.pasl (there's a bug that periodically deletes your pasl)
2) Copy .prm to /opt/pvs/var/pvs/plugins folder
3) re-start pvs/pvs-proxy
