Just a simple PRM, PASL, and include file that watches the network for TLS CLIENTHELLO packets and calculates the JA3 hash of the client
When we note a new JA3 hash on the network, we log it in realtime mode

To use:
0) Just copy the JA3.pasl to /opt/pvs/var/pvs/scripts folder. 
1) Copy the JA3.inc to /opt/pvs/var/pvs/scripts folder.
2) To be safe, run chattr +i /opt/pvs/var/pvs/scripts/JA3* (there's a bug that periodically deletes your pasl)
2) Copy JA3.prm to /opt/pvs/var/pvs/plugins folder
3) re-start pvs/pvs-proxy

To test:
cat /opt/pvs/var/pvs/log/realtime-logs.txt and find output like
