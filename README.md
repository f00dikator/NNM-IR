# NNM-IR
Incident Response (IR) plugins that detect stuff that I'm interested in detecting :) You'll need Nessus Network Monitor (NNM...formerly known as PVS) to use these...just throw them in the correct directories and re-start the pvs-proxy service...

Plugins for:
Detect when a client switches DNS servers (and, detect if they are connecting to a malicious DNS server)
JA3 hashing
IoT basic detection
TLS 1.3 clients
other misc. stuff
